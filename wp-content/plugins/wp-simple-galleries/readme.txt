A simple and easy to use plugin that adds an image gallery to each post and page on your site.

== Description ==

A simple plugin that adds an image gallery to each post and page. 
Most gallery plugins seem to be fancy and advanced but sometimes you just want a simple solution to add images to a post or page. I created this to solve that problem.
The plugin uses the Wordpress image manager, so you can add already uploaded images too a gallery.

You can now upload a number of images and add them all at once.

The plugin will either use thumbnails generated by WordPress (Settings -> Media -> Thumbnail Size).

Too add a gallery within the content use the shortcode [wpsgallery].

Requires WordPress 3.4 and PHP 5.

= Translators =
* Lithuanian (lt_LT) - [Vincent G] (http://www.host1free.com/)
* Ukrainian (uk_UA)
* Brazilian Portuguese (pt_BR)
* German (de_DE)

Some of the translations are incomplete. I have tried to translate some of the smaller phrase using Google, so they might not be correct.

**Current Features**

* Uses Wordpress image manager.

* Re-arrange images in galleries by drag-and-drop.
* Can set thumbnail size.
* Uses colorbox to view images
* Refactored options framework to prevent collisions
* Galleries are either appended to posts/pages or you can use the shortcode '[wpsgallery]' or '[wpsgallery id=2]' to show a gallery from another post/page.
